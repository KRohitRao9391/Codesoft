Quiz Maker - Minimal Runnable ZIP

How to run:

1. Extract the zip.
2. Install Node.js (v14+).
3. In terminal:
   cd quiz-maker/server
   npm install
   npm start

4. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

Notes:
- This demo stores quizzes in a JSON file at server/data/quizzes.json (no external DB).
- It's intentionally simple to run locally. For production, use a real DB and add authentication.

Enjoy!
